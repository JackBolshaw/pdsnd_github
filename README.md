### Date created
This project was created in January 2018.

### Project Title
Divvy Bike Share Analysis

### Description
The project is designed to give key insights into Divvy's Bike Share customer usage data.

Using NumPy and Pandas as imported libraries, the python code uses a series of loops to coax answers from the user to show data from a particular city in a particular month or day.

The python code then uses multiple dataframes to analyse key variables providing insights into the bike share data.

Once the data has been displayed the code then prompts the user whether they would like to see 5 lines of raw data and then asks the user whether they would like to view different filters.

### Files used
The files used during the project were:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
